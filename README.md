## What is this repo
This repository is a work-in-progress. It is based on, and it illustrates, the methods used for iterative, linear spectral demixing in this paper:

['Spatial connectivity matches direction selectivity in visual cortex'
Rossi, Harris, Carandini, Nature, 2020.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2894-4)

The algorithms and code are under constant development and improvement.
